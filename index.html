					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello, my name is Ian Jackson and I am currently 20 years old. At the moment I am living in Edmonton while attending my last year at NAIT.
					I am a computer enthusiast who is pursuing a career in the gaming industry. More specifically, I am wanting to become a game programmer. You can see some of my work through 
					the game tab located at the top. If you have any questions or wish to contact me, my personal information is located on the resume tab also located at the top. Have a great day!
